#Exercise Five Return Even Numbers 

# ? how to include: 'user.range <- x:n' after x <- 0
n <- readline(prompt="Enter a number: ")
n <- 10
x <- 0
print(list(seq(x, n, 5)))

# ? what does this mean: x %% 2 == 0
# ? what does this mean: is.even <- function(x)

# Different Attempt
n <- readline(prompt="Enter a number: ")
n
x <- 0
print(list(seq(x, n, 5)))
